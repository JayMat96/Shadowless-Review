# Summary
*Shadowless* is an adventure game. It's about an adventurer who wakes up without a shadow. You later learn that only the Queen of Shadows' minions are without shadows. You must face the Queen of Shadows and win back your shadow, as well as possibly find out why you lost your shadow in the first place.

*Shadowless* is an action/adventure game with some platforming and rpg elements. You progress through each level by defeating enemies, finding the room key, and unlocking the door at the end of the level. You can attack with your sword or bow and arrow. Enemies drop loot such as items, weapons, and coins. There are also treasure chests spread throughout the levels. You can also buy gear and weapons at the town shop which works as the central hub of the game. With the exception of the tutorial and the town, each level has a person who will upgrade one of your stats, much like leveling up in an RPG. The difference is, instead of having to grind, you just progress through the game to level up.

# Final Thoughts

There are some neat aspects of the game. For example, some levels have an extra doorway that leads to a dungeon. In these dungeons, you can find more loot.  There is also a survival-type mode where waves of enemies spawn. It's a good way of testing where you are level-wise and a quick way to earn money. If you can last long enough that is.  There are also in-game achievements you can play towards. Even better, is that the game rewards you when you earn these achievements, with various stat boosts.

The one thing that I loved the most is the treasure chests. Instead of finding a special key to open a treasure chest, you instead have to pick the chest's lock. This is a fun minigame which I liked quite a bit.

I did have some trouble getting the game started at first. The game had finished loading, but when I clicked the start button nothing happened. I clicked it a few more times and waited for a response, before clicking some more. I then decided to refresh the page. After the page refreshed and the game reloaded, I was able to click the start button and begin the game.

Another problem I ran into was when I was in the town. I found that you can hold either of the attack buttons to continuously attack. I did this to break open a crate to get some coins, but then the game froze. I tried moving the player around and clicking the game screen with the mouse, in case some other application took away from the game's priority. Not long after, the pause screen popped up, which I don't recall having pressed the pause button, but I could be mistaken. After that the game was slow to respawn and naviagting out of the pause menu was tedious. However, once I was able to close the pause screen, the game ran smoothly.

One final problem I found was in one of the game's levels. I had to fight an ogre which acted as the level's boss. I was able to get the ogre to kill itself by luring it into a bed of spikes. However, this was not my intention. I was just trying to get to higher ground and shoot arrows at the ogre from a safe distance, but he fell into the spikes. As it turns out, the ogre had the key to exit the level, so I had to restart that level.

I did have a lot of fun with the game. Finding new items and weapons alongside leveling up the player's stats is a good idea. That aspect, along with the dungeons and achievements encourages repetition and exploration. The music and graphics pair well to create the world and don't get annoying. I did not feel overpowered or underpowered. Overall, it was a pretty fun game
