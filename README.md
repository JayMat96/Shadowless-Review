# Summary
*Shadowless* is an adventure game. It's about an adventurer who wakes up without a shadow. You later learn that only the Queen of Shadows' minions are without shadows. You must face the Queen of Shadows and win back your shadow, as well as possibly find out why you lost your shadow in the first place.

*Shadowless* is an action/adventure game with some platforming and rpg elements. You progress through each level by defeating enemies, finding the room key, and unlocking the door at the end of the level. You can attack with your sword or bow and arrow. Enemies drop loot such as items, weapons, and coins. There are also treasure chests spread throughout the levels. You can also buy gear and weapons at the town shop which works as the central hub of the game. With the exception of the tutorial and the town, each level has a person who will upgrade one of your stats, much like leveling up in an RPG. The difference is, instead of having to grind, you just progress through the game to level up.
